# Boyer-Moore Implementation

Currently the only algorithm implemented is [Boyer-Moore-Horspool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore%E2%80%93Horspool_algorithm), in `src/bmh`.

Run `make` to build executable in `target/bmh`.
Run `make bench` to run the benchmarks.
The benchmarks require [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to run.
